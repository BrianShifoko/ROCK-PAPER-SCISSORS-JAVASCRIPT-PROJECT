# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game! This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic game where you compete against the computer to see who wins.

## Introduction

Rock Paper Scissors is a popular hand game played by two or more people. The game has simple rules: each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are "rock" (a fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The winner is determined based on the chosen shapes: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
